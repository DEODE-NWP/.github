## About

This software collection gathers repositories for the DE_330 project. Initially the focus is on the core engine for the numerical weather prediction (NWP) part but will be extended with other compontents as they mature. The currently available repositories are:

* The DEODE prototype which is the python framework around the NWP core of the model (Deode-Prototype)
* The main NWP code to be used for the engine (IAL)
* The HARMONIE-AROME version of the NWP code to be used for various investigations (Harmonie)

## Access

None of the projects are public and access to the organization may be given upon request to kpn_at_dmi.dk


### Acknowledgments
